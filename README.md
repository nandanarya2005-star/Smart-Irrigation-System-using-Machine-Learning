# Smart-Irrigation-System-using-Machine-Learning
A smart irrigation system uses machine learning to save water and give plants the right amount of water at the right time. It takes data from soil moisture, weather, and temperature, then predicts how much water the plants need. This system works automatically, reduces water wastage, increases crop growth, and helps farmers manage water efficiency
